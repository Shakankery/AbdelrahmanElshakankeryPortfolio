	<h1 class="text-center">Final Project</h1>
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
		Until now it was quite a journey. I take a alot of time at the beginning to come up with an idea and when I finally did I decided to change it <strong>Yeah Me !!</strong>.
		so if you have time plz bring a cup of coffe and let's from the beginning
	</p>

	<h3>First Station <strong>(Camera Gimbal)</strong></h3>	
	<h4>The problem:-</h4>
	<p>
		everyday in our lives we use our camera to take a picture or to record a videos it sound so easy ,but actually it's not, all of us suffer from poor quality, hand-shaking videos
		so in the field of videography we use a any sort of stablizer to make sure our footage come up with good quality.
	</p>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>
				Stablizer is mainly a device that seperate the operator movement from the camera movement, but there is some issues that we have to face using a stablizer
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
				<li>
					<h5>take alot of time and effort.</h5>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Delay in the responce time.</h5>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Cost a lot of money.</h5>
				</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<h4>IDEA In Nutshell</h4>
			<p>
				So the idea was really simple why wouldn't I use the technology of Digital Fabrication to create a motorized camera stablizer
			</p>	
			<p>
				The idea consist of main two parts <strong>Mechanical Design & Hardware Design</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<h5>Mechanical Design:Using Fusion360 and 3D printer</h5>
					<h5>Hardware Design: Controller, 3Moters, IMU, battery</h5>
				</ol>
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<div class="img-thumbnail">

	<h3>Second Station <strong>(Evaluation)</strong></h3>	
	<h4>Idea Evaluation:-</h4>
	<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>
					I start evaluating the idea based on three main point 
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h5>Are the problem big enough?</h5>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Are the stackholder aware of the problem and able to buy it?</h5>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>if someone make the same idea Did it work?why?</h5>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>it was a nice reasearch I came up with a lot of finding:-</p>
				<p>
					1- The problem is really big as I think it's a lot of people aware of it, but some of them try to solve it using handheld tech or buy a gimbal that already exist in the market
				</p>
				<p>
					2- The question have changed from <strong>How to make a stable footage in motion?</strong> To <strong>How to create content with good quality ?</strong> and that was another story, it wasn't about the gear you use it was about the content itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					3-a lot of people doesn't aware of the technology of Digital Fabrication so the part in which I want to contribute to the community and make it possible for anyone to create his/her own gimbal using 3D printer wasn't fully fullfilled. 
				</p>

			<div class="col-md-6">
				<div class="img-thumbnail">

			</div>
	</div>
	<hr>

	<h3>Third Station <strong>( Design Thinking Process )</strong></h3>	
	<h4>Trust the process:-</h4>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<div class="img-thumbnail">
				<img src="Design thinking process.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			let's frame our work before we start it. From the previouse finding another idea came up to my mind <strong>How to simplify and spread the technology of Digital Fabrication?</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			with two idea in my mind it's time now to start our design thinking process, but first lets make sure to choose the right target audince 
		</p>

		<div class="col-md-2"></div>

		<div class="col-md-8">
			<div class="img-thumbnail">
				<img src="Empathy.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
				<p class="text-center"><strong>Empathy discussion guide for both ideas</strong></p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
		<h5>Idea Filteration</h5>
		<p>
			In order to save time I must choose one idea before statring empathy with people  
			I compare between the two ideas in the term of why would I like to do it ?  
		</p>	
		<p>
			- In both the challenges are huge and I'll turn out with decent amount of knowledge, but I find that <strong>Simplifying Digital fabrication Technology</strong> has the most impact and a huge contribution to the  community. 
		</p>
	</div>
	<hr>

	<h3>Forth Station <strong>( Start the journey ...)</strong></h3>	
	<h4>Empathy phase:-</h4>
	<p>
		The Empathy phase was about interacting with students and some of fab lab community members getting to know about their journey in the field of digital fabrication, their opinion in how to simplify knowledge and the problems they face in selflearning. 
	</p>
	<p class="text-center">
		<strong>I came up with alot of insights</strong>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p class="text-center">
				 First in how to simplify your content
			</p>
			<p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					the content should has a clear objective
				</li>
				<li>
					should be simple, clear and easy to follow
				</li>
				<li>
					organized in form of storytelling
				</li>
				<li>
					clear connection between therotical and practical part
				</li>
				<li>
					very detailed with all tips and tricks
				</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p class="text-center">
				 Second in how to present your content (Platform)
			</p>
			<p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					visually comfortable: Design, style, color.
				</li>
				<li>
					Flexible and Engagment: Learn anytime anywhere.
				</li>
				<li>
					Supportive and Encouragment: Allow sharing their work and giving personal feedback on their personal development.
				</li>
				<li>
					Interactive:Students, content, Instructor.
				</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>
		In case of digital fabrication we need to make it more related to a specific field <strong>show</strong> how it really related to our community and <strong>tell</strong> about it's impact on our lives.
